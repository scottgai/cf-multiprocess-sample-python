# cf-multiprocess-sample-python
CF multiprocess sample app for python

### Deploying

Push the app:

`cf push`


By default, only the web process starts.
To start the worker process as well:

`cf scale multiprocess-sample -p worker -i 1`


Verify:
```
cf app multiprocess-sample
cf processes multiprocess-sample
```

You‚Äôll see both web and worker processes listed.

üìã Notes

Each process runs in its own container (CF ‚Äúinstance‚Äù).

The web process is bound to routes and receives HTTP traffic.

The worker process runs independently ‚Äî useful for background jobs, message queue consumers, etc.

Logs for each process type can be viewed with:

`cf logs multiprocess-sample --recent`
